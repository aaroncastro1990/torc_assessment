# TORC RUBY Assessment
## This was created to complete the assessment

The Ruby solution provided is in a lib package, all classes are created to work together and follow some applicable design patterns, such as Factory, Templates, Single responsabilities, etc

## Execution
- To execute the code you need to install ruby on your machine, and run the following command:
```sh
    ruby execute.rb
```
The script will execute the program to return and print the result.

## Custom Input
- To add a custom input, a `.txt` file is required, and you need to edit the `Custom Input` block in the `execute.rb` file and set the path to your file. In Example:
```sh
    # execute.rb
    25: file_path = "your_awesome_file_path"
```
- The custom input format should be the following:
```txt
2 book at 12.49
1 music CD at 14.99
1 chocolate bar at 0.85
```
- The script will take care of everything.

## RSPEC
- To execute `rspec` you need to install the `rspec gem` by running:
```sh
gem install rspec
gem install rspec-expectations
```

Then run the rspec command:
```sh
rspec
```
## Enjoy =)
